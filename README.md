# Predicting Local Changes in Sea Level

Sea level is rising on a global scale due to thermal expansion and melting glaciers. While there is already much work done to predict rise in sea level worldwide, we want to predict local sea level changes on a smaller time scale. Predicting changes in sea level on the regional level is important because rise in sea level is a safety concern to those living close to the coast, can harm both land and sea ecosystems, and can destroy infrastructure.

Our objective in this project is to analyze and predict changes in sea level by city based on regional factors such as consecutive dry days, precipitation, and frequency of low/high temperatures.
